Laser-Pandas
============
This is inspired by the original Laser Pandas developed by Shawn Cornally: http://shawncornally.com/wordpress/?p=2499

This version is being developed by students in South Hamilton's "current science" course: http://leifsegen.com/schoolblog/courses/current-science/

The need for a programmed version was perceived after it became clear that every turn of the game required 8x8 Punnet squares. Developers saw this as a prereq to version 2.0.

Processing.org is the development environment for now.
